This is a collection of trivial functions to facilitate generating and exploring test coverage information for Julia packages *locally*, without using any remote/cloud services.

## Installation

This package is not (yet) registered. You need to install it with

```julia
Pkg.clone("https://github.com/tpapp/LocalCoverage.jl.git")
```

Generating HTML needs the `genhtml` utility, which is part of [LCOV](http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php). On Debian/Ubuntu systems, use

```sh
sudo apt install lcov
```

Note that the code in this package assumes a reasonably recent `lcov` version when calling `genhtml`, ideally `1.13`, but `1.12` should work too. This only checked when building this package, and does not prevent installation, only emits a warning. See the discussion of [issue #1](https://github.com/tpapp/LocalCoverage.jl/issues/1) for a workaround.

## Usage

```julia
using LocalCoverage
import Foo              # import the target package for coverage
generate_coverage(Foo)  # generate coverage information
open_coverage(Foo)      # open in a browser
clean_coverage(Foo)     # cleanup
```
